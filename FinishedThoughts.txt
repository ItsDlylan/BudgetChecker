Troubles Had while working through this project were:
Functionality: Adding a whole new page with its own logic following the
budget page's data model, I had to figure out how to grab the 
input type="month"'s value and split it into its own array to grab
the month and year that was inputed. 

Learned how to pause scrolling to make a single page web app

UI: I force placed every div with position absolute, I now realize how terrible
that actually can be with making it responsive like holy shit, did it make me want to die.


Things I will do better when I come back and refactor.
1) new UI I want to redesign past Jonas's design.
2) Turn it into a react app for states with animations for the scrolling 
animation of the page.
3) Learn Local Storage and turn all the info into local storage 
in case of a refresh
4) add a printable option
